# JS Calculator
A JS arithmetric calculator built with basic web technologies (HTML, CSS & JS). This task was quite challanging and after a few cups of coffee and some slices of waffles, I was finally able to do it. `Inner voice screaammms` "Hooray!!"

## Features
- All basic arithmetric calculations(divide, multiply, subtract, add and percentage)
- AC function that clears the screen


## Project Idea
This project was one of the tasks required by the OdinProject.
